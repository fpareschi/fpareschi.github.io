    - title: Reducing Consumer Inertia in Tobacco Markets (JMP, draft coming soon)
      link: #/assets/files/inertia_tobacco_latest.pdf
      abstract: |
        Despite decades-long efforts to discourage smoking, the tobacco industry remains resilient 
        partly due to consumers' physical and psychological dependence. Recently, regulators have 
        proposed nicotine caps and standardized packaging, known to decrease addiction and
        loyalty, the two primary sources of inertia in the market. In response, tobacco 
        companies argue that lowering inertia will intensify price competition, making cheaper 
        alternatives available and raising consumption. We study the impact of reducing addiction
        and loyalty on cigarette consumption. To analyze this problem, we develop a dynamic model 
        of price competition under inertia that considers firms' product assortment. We adopt a 
        computationally efficient equilibrium solution to make it empirically tractable and use rich 
        variation from the Uruguayan tobacco market to estimate its primitives. We argue that 
        equilibrium effects depend on how firms balance their incentives to capture new customers 
        and profit from existing ones. If by reducing inertia, firms' incentives to attract new 
        consumers decrease enough; then prices might increase instead. Indeed, we show that 
        sizable drops in brand loyalty lead to higher prices. Even if firms lower prices, the direct 
        effect on consumers might dominate, as in the case of lowering addiction. Finally, we 
        illustrate that eliminating inertia increases tax efficacy to deter consumption. In our
        context, taxes discourage firms from expanding their customer base, leading to higher tax 
        pass-through. Hence, by lowering inertia firms pass less of the tax to customers. We contend 
        this is positive for governments because they can reduce smoking prevalence while sacrificing 
        less revenue.

    - title: Bounding Outcomes in Counterfactual Analysis
      link: #
      abstract: |
        In many economic settings, counterfactual analysis can be difficult 
        for two reasons: (i) we do not know how to compute the equilibrium 
        of the game, or (ii) even if we know how to compute one equilibrium,
        the game might feature multiple equilibria, which are difficult to 
        exhaustively characterize. We propose a new methodology to allow for
        counterfactual analysis even when these problems might arise. The 
        method relies on determining valid (conservative) bounds to counterfactual
        outcomes that contain any outcome that could be sustained in equilibrium,
        i.e., any outcome that can be supported by a set of equilibrium constraints.
        To ensure that all potential solutions are considered, We propose
        to reframe equilibrium constraints as a relaxed mixed-integer 
        linear program. We show that the framework can also be used to 
        narrow down equilibria, by imposing additional equilibrium constraints.
        We provide examples related to static price competition, multi-unit 
        auctions and dynamic games,
        three areas in which counterfactual analysis has proven elusive.

    - title: Public Provision under Market Power. Evidence from a Nationalization in the Argentina Gasoline Industry
      link: #
      abstract: |
        We study the nationalization of YPF, Argentina's leading gasoline company. We find that the
        nationalization led to lower gasoline prices, particularly for inelastic demand products, 
        and varying price reductions across geographic regions, favoring consumers who have 
        political ties with the firm. We develop and estimate a model of supply and demand of
        gasoline and recover the objective function of the State-Owned Enterprise (SOE), allowing
        for heterogeneity in the way in which the SOE internalizes different groups of consumers
        and firms. Our analysis reveals a dual impact of the nationalization: reduced
        economic price discrimination, benefiting consumers on average, but increased 
        political price discrimination, favoring particular groups over others based 
        on political attributes. We then use the model to evaluate policy alternatives, 
        including privatization and regulations that limit SOEs' discretion, to inform the 
        current debate surrounding SOEs in different countries. These findings shed light on
        the complexities of public provision, emphasizing the role of politics and interest
        groups in shaping SOEs actions and their distributional consequences.

        link: # "https://drive.google.com/open?id=16I7tRB-XFKtr3k2JFtrm9l6u7RcmagGD&usp=drive_fs"
        abstract: |
          We study the effect of consumer inertia on industry dynamics. We develop a novel dynamic 
          model of price competition that integrates entry, exit, and consumer state dependence. 
          We first simulate the model in a simple environment using Markov Perfect Equilibrium (MPE) 
          as the equilibrium concept. We then parametrize the model using data from the tobacco 
          industry and compare the performance of different equilibrium notions that allow us to keep 
          the model empirically tractable. Our findings reveal that consumer inertia leads to lower 
          equilibrium prices but does not significantly affect market participation or product 
          variety. We observe that state dependence only results in higher prices and concentrated 
          markets if nearly all customers are repeat buyers and participation costs are high. We 
          propose several approximations of the MPE that researchers can apply to other markets and 
          problems where inertia and participation are relevant. To demonstrate its usefulness in 
          policy design, we examine the impact of inertia on merger evaluation.

      - title: "Insurance under information frictions in the
        electricity market"
        link: #
        coauthors: with Mar Reguant
        abstract: |
          The emergence of Real Time Pricing has 
          generated expectations of achieving efficiency 
          in the electricity market. However, consumers have 
          appeared reluctant to accept the bill volatility 
          caused by time variant tariffs. Thus, eliciting
          consumer preferences is a prerequisite to correctly 
          assess the welfare impact of a broad implementation 
          of RTP . In this paper we use detailed household level data from 
          the Spanish electricity market to study how household characteristics
          and preferences influence their electricity tariff choice. We provide model
          free evidence to illustrate that consumers' choices are not only the resolution 
          to a trade-off between mean payments and volatility which resembles that of 
          an insurance market, but are also driven by information frictions and inattention.
          We then recover consumer preferences using an empirical model demand for insurance.
