    - title: Curbing Habit Formation. The Effects of Tobacco Control Policies in a Dynamic Equilibrium
      link: /assets/files/inertia_tobacco_latest.pdf
      abstract: |
        We study the equilibrium effects of tobacco control policies. To accurately assess the 
        impact of tobacco regulation on consumption, it is essential to understand how firms 
        respond. We highlight that consumers' dependence on cigarettes, which we refer to as 
        consumer inertia, introduces dynamic incentives for firms. Thus, we develop a 
        dynamic oligopoly model and estimate it using product-level data and a panel of smokers. 
        Leveraging large tax fluctuations and a policy that forced approximately 40\% of products 
        out of the market, we show that consumers have significant addiction and brand loyalty. We 
        then propose a tractable equilibrium notion to compute market outcomes and show that dynamic 
        competition models under inertia capture firm behavior well. We use this framework to 
        examine the counterfactual effect of uniform packaging restrictions and caps on nicotine 
        concentration. We highlight that firms' price and portfolio responses account for a 
        substantial part of the overall policy effect. Moreover, we stress that more simplistic 
        models of static competition would have led to significantly different conclusions about 
        expected companies' responses.

    - title: How Do Governments Engage in Price Discrimination? Evidence from a Large-Scale Nationalization
      link: https://gaston-lopez.github.io/GastonLopez-JMP-latest.pdf
      abstract: |
        State-owned enterprises (SOEs) have the potential to correct market failures, but they are 
        also subject to the influence of politics and interest groups. We examine this trade-off in 
        the context of the nationalization of the leading gasoline company in Argentina. Descriptive 
        analysis suggests that pricing patterns changed after the nationalization. First, the 
        government exerted less market power, charging lower prices on average and benefiting 
        consumers. Second, it engaged in less economic price discrimination, reducing the correlation 
        between prices and consumers' willingness to pay. Third, it engaged in political price 
        discrimination, charging lower prices in provinces with political connections with the 
        state-owned firm. Motivated by these findings, we develop and estimate a model of gasoline 
        supply and demand under market power and recover the government's objective function. We 
        find that public provision lead to welfare gains but is also associated with redistributive 
        motives. Compared to a benevolent planner that internalizes the welfare of all consumers 
        and firms equally, the government set prices as if it only cares about favoring middle-income 
        consumers and consumers in provinces that have political ties with the firm. Lastly, we use 
        the model to assess the company's response to policy alternatives, including pricing rules 
        that align government actions with the public interest and are in place in government 
        agencies worldwide. Our findings show that rules effectively reduce the influence of 
        politics in pricing but are associated with higher costs: they mitigate half of the welfare 
        gains generated by the nationalization and increase the taxpayers' burden by 10%. These 
        findings emphasize the importance of politics and interest groups in shaping governments' 
        decision-making process and the role of SOEs as instruments for redistribution.

    - title: Bounding Outcomes in Counterfactual Analysis
      link: /assets/files/bounds_latest.pdf
      abstract: |
        In many economic settings, counterfactual analysis can be difficult for two reasons: (i) we 
        do not know how to compute the equilibrium of the game, or (ii) even if we know how to 
        compute one equilibrium, the game might feature multiple equilibria, which are challenging 
        to characterize exhaustively. We propose a bounding framework to allow for counterfactual 
        analysis even when these problems might arise. The method relies on determining valid 
        (conservative) bounds to counterfactual outcomes that contain any outcome that could be 
        sustained in equilibrium, i.e., any outcome that can be supported by a set of equilibrium 
        constraints. To ensure that all potential solutions are considered, We propose to reframe 
        equilibrium constraints as a relaxed mixed-integer linear program. We show that the 
        framework can also be used to narrow down equilibria by imposing additional equilibrium 
        constraints. We provide examples of static price competition with differentiated products, 
        dynamic games, and multi-unit auctions, three areas where counterfactual analysis faces 
        these challenges.
