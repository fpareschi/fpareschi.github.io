    - title: Reducing Consumer Inertia in Tobacco Markets (JMP, draft coming soon)
      link: #/assets/files/inertia_tobacco_latest.pdf
      abstract: |
        We study the equilibrium effects of tobacco control policies. Despite decades-long efforts 
        to discourage smoking, the tobacco industry remains resilient. One of the main reasons is 
        consumers' attachment to the products they smoke, which we call \emph{consumer inertia}. We 
        explore two reasons consumers are attached to their products: they get addicted to nicotine 
        and develop lasting brand loyalty to their products. Recently, regulators have proposed some 
        policies that would eliminate the addictive components of cigarettes and others that make 
        consumers less loyal to their brands. Although such policies would directly impact 
        consumers, we must understand firms' responses to assess their impact on consumption. 
        Consumer inertia introduces dynamic incentives for the firms since future demand depends 
        on current choices. As a result, consumers become a valuable asset for the firm; capturing 
        new customers is more costly, and exploiting existing ones is more attractive. Consequently, 
        firms modify how they price, introduce, and discontinue products. To assess the empirical 
        effect of reducing inertia in tobacco markets, we develop a model that accounts for 
        consumers and firm responses: consumers have addiction and loyalty, and firms choose 
        prices and product portfolios. We estimate the model leveraging rich variation from the 
        Uruguayan industry and solve the dynamic game for multiple counterfactual levels of inertia. 
        We find that firms' responses make policies more effective in reducing consumption because 
        lowering inertia also discourages firms from investing in attracting customers, who are less 
        likely to repeat consumption choices. However, if the policies do not make smokers more 
        likely to quit, they can \emph{backfire} by increasing competition and facilitating the 
        entry of new products.

    - title: Public Provision under Market Power. Evidence from a Nationalization in the Argentina Gasoline Industry
      link: #
      abstract: |
        We study the nationalization of YPF, Argentina's leading gasoline company. We find that the 
        nationalization led to lower gasoline prices, particularly for inelastic demand products, 
        and varying price reductions across geographic regions, favoring consumers who have 
        political ties with the firm. We develop and estimate a model of supply and demand of 
        gasoline and recover the objective function of the State-Owned Enterprise (SOE), allowing 
        for heterogeneity in how the SOE internalizes different groups of consumers and firms. Our 
        analysis reveals a dual impact of the nationalization: reduced economic price 
        discrimination, benefiting consumers on average and increasing total welfare, but 
        increased political price discrimination, favoring particular groups over others 
        based on political attributes. We then use the model to evaluate the firm's response to 
        policy alternatives, including privatization and regulations that limit SOEs' discretion, 
        to inform the current debate surrounding SOEs in different countries. We found that limiting 
        government discretion effectively reduces political price discrimination but negatively 
        affects overall welfare and government revenues. These findings shed light on the complexities 
        of public provision, emphasizing the role of interest groups and politics in shaping government 
        decision-making and their distributional consequences.

    - title: Bounding Outcomes in Counterfactual Analysis
      link: /assets/files/bounds_latest.pdf
      abstract: |
        In many economic settings, counterfactual analysis can be difficult 
        for two reasons: (i) we do not know how to compute the equilibrium 
        of the game, or (ii) even if we know how to compute one equilibrium,
        the game might feature multiple equilibria, which are difficult to 
        exhaustively characterize. We propose a new methodology to allow for
        counterfactual analysis even when these problems might arise. The 
        method relies on determining valid (conservative) bounds to counterfactual
        outcomes that contain any outcome that could be sustained in equilibrium,
        i.e., any outcome that can be supported by a set of equilibrium constraints.
        To ensure that all potential solutions are considered, We propose
        to reframe equilibrium constraints as a relaxed mixed-integer 
        linear program. We show that the framework can also be used to 
        narrow down equilibria, by imposing additional equilibrium constraints.
        We provide examples related to static price competition, multi-unit 
        auctions and dynamic games,
        three areas in which counterfactual analysis has proven elusive.

        link: # "https://drive.google.com/open?id=16I7tRB-XFKtr3k2JFtrm9l6u7RcmagGD&usp=drive_fs"
        abstract: |
          We study the effect of consumer inertia on industry dynamics. We develop a dynamic model 
          of price competition that integrates entry, exit, and consumer inertia. We first simulate 
          the model in a simple environment using Markov Perfect Equilibrium as the equilibrium 
          concept. Our findings reveal that consumer inertia leads to lower equilibrium prices but 
          does not significantly affect market participation or product variety. We observe that 
          state dependence only results in higher prices and concentrated markets if nearly all 
          customers are repeat buyers and participation costs are high. We propose several 
          alternative equilibrium definitions that researchers can apply to empirical settings 
          problems where inertia and participation are relevant. We use these techniques to 
          parametrize the model using data from the tobacco industry and compare the performance 
          of different equilibrium notions. To demonstrate its usefulness in policy design, we 
          examine the impact of inertia on merger evaluation.

      - title: "Insurance under information frictions in the electricity market"
        link: #
        coauthors: with Mar Reguant
        abstract: |
          The emergence of Real Time Pricing has 
          generated expectations of achieving efficiency 
          in the electricity market. However, consumers have 
          appeared reluctant to accept the bill volatility 
          caused by time variant tariffs. Thus, eliciting
          consumer preferences is a prerequisite to correctly 
          assess the welfare impact of a broad implementation 
          of RTP . In this paper we use detailed household level data from 
          the Spanish electricity market to study how household characteristics
          and preferences influence their electricity tariff choice. We provide model
          free evidence to illustrate that consumers' choices are not only the resolution 
          to a trade-off between mean payments and volatility which resembles that of 
          an insurance market, but are also driven by information frictions and inattention.
          We then recover consumer preferences using an empirical model demand for insurance.
