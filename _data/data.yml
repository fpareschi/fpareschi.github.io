    - title: Reducing Consumer Inertia in Tobacco Markets (JMP, draft coming soon)
      link: # "https://drive.google.com/open?id=16I7tRB-XFKtr3k2JFtrm9l6u7RcmagGD&usp=drive_fs"
      abstract: |
        We explore the effects of reducing addiction and brand loyalty on tobacco consumption. 
        Our study responds to the Federal Drug Administration and the World Health Organization's 
        initiatives to decrease consumer state dependence through nicotine caps and plain packaging. 
        Our research shows that policies aiming at reducing consumer state dependence can backfire by
        increasing consumption through lower prices and making taxes less effective at reducing 
        smoking prevalence. To reach this conclusion, we first develop a novel model of dynamic 
        price competition that considers entry, exit, and consumer inertia. Crucially, we illustrate
        how to make this model empirically tractable by adopting a computationally efficient 
        equilibrium solution. Solving the model for several consumer inertia parameters, we 
        note that the relationship between inertia and consumption is non-monotonic and concave.
        We then leverage unique variation from the Uruguayan tobacco industry to show that both
        addiction and brand loyalty are relevant, and that firms consider consumers' inertia while
        making business decisions. Finally, we show that modest drops in consumer state dependence 
        from our baseline estimates tend to decrease prices and increase aggregate consumption. 
        However, completely eliminating inertia leads to higher prices without a substantial effect on
        the number of available products, which reduces aggregate consumption.

    - title: Bounding Outcomes in Counterfactual Analysis
      link: #
      abstract: |
        In many economic settings, counterfactual analysis can be difficult 
        for two reasons: (i) we do not know how to compute the equilibrium 
        of the game, or (ii) even if we know how to compute one equilibrium,
        the game might feature multiple equilibria, which are difficult to 
        exhaustively characterize. We propose a new methodology to allow for
        counterfactual analysis even when these problems might arise. The 
        method relies on determining valid (conservative) bounds to counterfactual
        outcomes that contain any outcome that could be sustained in equilibrium,
        i.e., any outcome that can be supported by a set of equilibrium constraints.
        To ensure that all potential solutions are considered, We propose
        to reframe equilibrium constraints as a relaxed mixed-integer 
        linear program. We show that the framework can also be used to 
        narrow down equilibria, by imposing additional equilibrium constraints.
        We provide examples related to static price competition, multi-unit 
        auctions and dynamic games,
        three areas in which counterfactual analysis has proven elusive.

    - title: Public Provision under Market Power. Evidence from a Nationalization in the Argentina Gasoline Industry
      link: #
      abstract: |
        We study the nationalization of YPF, Argentina's leading gasoline company. We find that the
        nationalization led to lower gasoline prices, particularly for inelastic demand products, 
        and varying price reductions across geographic regions, favoring consumers who have 
        political ties with the firm. We develop and estimate a model of supply and demand of
        gasoline and recover the objective function of the State-Owned Enterprise (SOE), allowing
        for heterogeneity in the way in which the SOE internalizes different groups of consumers
        and firms. Our analysis reveals a dual impact of the nationalization: reduced
        economic price discrimination, benefiting consumers on average, but increased 
        political price discrimination, favoring particular groups over others based 
        on political attributes. We then use the model to evaluate policy alternatives, 
        including privatization and regulations that limit SOEs' discretion, to inform the 
        current debate surrounding SOEs in different countries. These findings shed light on
        the complexities of public provision, emphasizing the role of politics and interest
        groups in shaping SOEs actions and their distributional consequences.

        link: # "https://drive.google.com/open?id=16I7tRB-XFKtr3k2JFtrm9l6u7RcmagGD&usp=drive_fs"
        abstract: |
          We study the effect of consumer inertia on industry dynamics. We develop a novel dynamic 
          model of price competition that integrates entry, exit, and consumer state dependence. 
          We first simulate the model in a simple environment using Markov Perfect Equilibrium (MPE) 
          as the equilibrium concept. We then parametrize the model using data from the tobacco 
          industry and compare the performance of different equilibrium notions that allow us to keep 
          the model empirically tractable. Our findings reveal that consumer inertia leads to lower 
          equilibrium prices but does not significantly affect market participation or product 
          variety. We observe that state dependence only results in higher prices and concentrated 
          markets if nearly all customers are repeat buyers and participation costs are high. We 
          propose several approximations of the MPE that researchers can apply to other markets and 
          problems where inertia and participation are relevant. To demonstrate its usefulness in 
          policy design, we examine the impact of inertia on merger evaluation.

      - title: "Insurance under information frictions in the
        electricity market"
        link: #
        coauthors: with Mar Reguant
        abstract: |
          The emergence of Real Time Pricing has 
          generated expectations of achieving efficiency 
          in the electricity market. However, consumers have 
          appeared reluctant to accept the bill volatility 
          caused by time variant tariffs. Thus, eliciting
          consumer preferences is a prerequisite to correctly 
          assess the welfare impact of a broad implementation 
          of RTP . In this paper we use detailed household level data from 
          the Spanish electricity market to study how household characteristics
          and preferences influence their electricity tariff choice. We provide model
          free evidence to illustrate that consumers' choices are not only the resolution 
          to a trade-off between mean payments and volatility which resembles that of 
          an insurance market, but are also driven by information frictions and inattention.
          We then recover consumer preferences using an empirical model demand for insurance.
