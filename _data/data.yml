    - title: Reducing Consumer Inertia in Tobacco Markets (JMP)
      link: /assets/files/inertia_tobacco_latest.pdf
      abstract: |
        We study the equilibrium effects of tobacco control policies. While tobacco control measures 
        typically target consumers, it is crucial to understand firms' responses to assess these 
        policies' impact on consumption. We highlight that consumers' dependence on cigarettes, 
        which we refer to as consumer inertia, introduces dynamic incentives for firms. 
        Thus, we develop a dynamic oligopoly model and estimate it using product-level data and a 
        panel of smokers. Leveraging large tax fluctuations and a policy that forced approximately 
        40% of products out of the market, we show that consumers face significant addiction and 
        brand loyalty. We use these estimated preferences to demonstrate the importance of 
        considering firms' dynamic incentives to explain their observed behavior. Lastly, we 
        propose a tractable equilibrium notion to compute market outcomes. We use this framework 
        to examine the counterfactual effect of uniform packaging restrictions and caps on nicotine 
        concentration. We show that firms' responses tend to reinforce the direct effect of these 
        policies. Supply responses strengthen the direct effect because companies' incentives to 
        attract new consumers decrease, since retaining them in the future becomes harder. These 
        dynamic incentives reverse firms' short-term considerations. For example, firms can amplify 
        the impact of uniform packaging even though demand elasticity increases by up to three 
        times and the expected number of products expands by as much as 30%.

    - title: How Do Governments Engage in Price Discrimination? Evidence from a Large-Scale Nationalization
      link: https://gaston-lopez.github.io/GastonLopez-JMP-latest.pdf
      abstract: |
        State-owned enterprises (SOEs) have the potential to correct market failures, but they are 
        also subject to the influence of politics and interest groups. We examine this trade-off in 
        the context of the nationalization of the leading gasoline company in Argentina. Descriptive 
        analysis suggests that pricing patterns changed after the nationalization. First, the 
        government exerted less market power, charging lower prices on average and benefiting 
        consumers. Second, it engaged in less economic price discrimination, reducing the correlation 
        between prices and consumers' willingness to pay. Third, it engaged in political price 
        discrimination, charging lower prices in provinces with political connections with the 
        state-owned firm. Motivated by these findings, we develop and estimate a model of gasoline 
        supply and demand under market power and recover the government's objective function. We 
        find that public provision lead to welfare gains but is also associated with redistributive 
        motives. Compared to a benevolent planner that internalizes the welfare of all consumers 
        and firms equally, the government set prices as if it only cares about favoring middle-income 
        consumers and consumers in provinces that have political ties with the firm. Lastly, we use 
        the model to assess the company's response to policy alternatives, including pricing rules 
        that align government actions with the public interest and are in place in government 
        agencies worldwide. Our findings show that rules effectively reduce the influence of 
        politics in pricing but are associated with higher costs: they mitigate half of the welfare 
        gains generated by the nationalization and increase the taxpayers' burden by 10%. These 
        findings emphasize the importance of politics and interest groups in shaping governments' 
        decision-making process and the role of SOEs as instruments for redistribution.

    - title: Bounding Outcomes in Counterfactual Analysis
      link: /assets/files/bounds_latest.pdf
      abstract: |
        In many economic settings, counterfactual analysis can be difficult for two reasons: (i) we 
        do not know how to compute the equilibrium of the game, or (ii) even if we know how to 
        compute one equilibrium, the game might feature multiple equilibria, which are challenging 
        to characterize exhaustively. We propose a bounding framework to allow for counterfactual 
        analysis even when these problems might arise. The method relies on determining valid 
        (conservative) bounds to counterfactual outcomes that contain any outcome that could be 
        sustained in equilibrium, i.e., any outcome that can be supported by a set of equilibrium 
        constraints. To ensure that all potential solutions are considered, We propose to reframe 
        equilibrium constraints as a relaxed mixed-integer linear program. We show that the 
        framework can also be used to narrow down equilibria by imposing additional equilibrium 
        constraints. We provide examples of static price competition with differentiated products, 
        dynamic games, and multi-unit auctions, three areas where counterfactual analysis faces 
        these challenges.

      - title: Industry dynamics in markets with inertia 
        link: # "https://drive.google.com/open?id=16I7tRB-XFKtr3k2JFtrm9l6u7RcmagGD&usp=drive_fs"
        abstract: |
          I study the effect of consumer inertia on industry dynamics. I develop a dynamic model of 
          price competition that integrates entry, exit, and consumer inertia. I first simulate the 
          model in a simple environment using Markov Perfect Equilibrium as the equilibrium concept. 
          We show that, in this context, consumer inertia only results in higher prices and concentrated markets if nearly all 
          customers are repeat buyers and participation costs are high. Then, I stress that the 
          MPE is inappropriate to study these industries due to the high computational requirements 
          both to market participants and analysts. Thus, I consider an alternative equilibrium 
          concept where firms condition in their own state and some market aggregates to form 
          beliefs about rivals' states and actions. I evaluate the effect of introducing 
          more information and alternative approximations of beliefs on industry outcomes and 
          compare these outcomes to the underlying MPE's steady state. In this context, the 
          comparison is possible even with many firms since the MPE's steady state can be computed 
          without fully solving equilibrium strategies. Finally, I demonstrate the usefulness of 
          these methods in policy design by analyzing the effect of inertia on merger evaluation, 
          particularly on assessing the "entry defense".

      - title: Misallocation of water. The role of storage
        link: # 
        coauthors: with Matthew O'Keefe
        abstract:
          We study the effects of storage on the allocative efficiency of water markets. 
          Water rights have been historically hard to transact. Water markets, in turn, 
          enable farmers and other users to trade water endowments at a lower cost, resulting in 
          more efficient use of water. Regulated water systems, such as the well-known 
          Murray-Darling water basin in Australia, make water a storable good. In particular, 
          the Australian market has partially decentralized the storage choice to individual 
          farmers. The possibility of storage allows farmers to self-insure against weather shocks. 
          However, private storage might fail to internalize its social costs. There are two primary 
          sources of inefficiencies. First, storage reduces average supply by increasing losses 
          through dam spills and evaporation. Second, storage can reduce market participation, 
          harming the intra-temporal water allocation. We focus on the second source of inefficiency. 
          Concretely, we develop a dynamic model of farmers' land, irrigation, water transactions, 
          and storage decisions under uncertainty about price and water availability and use it to 
          solve the market equilibrium. We use production data from Australian farmers and actual 
          transactions to quantify the tradeoff between individual welfare gains from self-insurance 
          and losses from limited market participation. Then, we plan to explore how alternative 
          storage rules perform. 
            

      - title: "Insurance under information frictions in the electricity market"
        link: #
        coauthors: with Mar Reguant
        abstract: |
          The emergence of Real-Time Pricing has generated expectations of achieving efficiency in 
          the electricity market. However, consumers have appeared reluctant to accept the bill 
          volatility caused by time-variant tariffs. In this paper, we use detailed household-level 
          data from the Spanish electricity market to study the determinants of electricity tariff 
          choice. We provide model-free evidence that consumers' choices are not only the resolution 
          to a trade-off between mean payments and volatility but are also influenced by information 
          frictions and inattention. We highlight that even consumers who make active choices make 
          largely incorrect assessments of the distribution of payments under fixed and variable 
          prices. In particular, we find that significant deviations from the expected utility 
          framework are required to rationalize customer choices. This result underscores that 
          information interventions cannot be directed only to inattentive consumers, but they 
          also need to inform about the cost distribution of each alternative. The next step is 
          to estimate an empirical model of demand for insurance under information frictions and 
          use it to evaluate the effect of information provision on RTP adoption.
