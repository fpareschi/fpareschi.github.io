      link: # "https://drive.google.com/open?id=16I7tRB-XFKtr3k2JFtrm9l6u7RcmagGD&usp=drive_fs"
      abstract: |
        In this study, we focus on the effect of consumer inertia on industry dynamics. We develop a new

        dynamic model of price competition, entry, and exit. We then apply it to the Uruguayan tobacco 
        industry. The model reveals that consumer inertia makes the entry of new products harder but also lowers

        equilibrium prices, resulting in an overall positive effect on consumers' welfare. We show how to relax
        the traditional Markov Perfect Equilibrium to make models of dynamic price competition amenable to
        empirical analysis. Our empirical strategy can be extrapolated to other industries and policy problems
        where inertia and participation are critical. To illustrate, we investigate consumer inertiaâ€™s influence on
        the design of taxes in the Uruguayan tobacco industry.

    - title: Bounding Outcomes in Counterfactual Analysis
      link: #
      abstract: |
        In many economic settings, counterfactual analysis can be difficult 
        for two reasons: (i) we do not know how to compute the equilibrium 
        of the game, or (ii) even if we know how to compute one equilibrium,
        the game might feature multiple equilibria, which are difficult to 
        exhaustively characterize. We propose a new methodology to allow for
        counterfactual analysis even when these problems might arise. The 
        method relies on determining valid (conservative) bounds to counterfactual
        outcomes that contain any outcome that could be sustained in equilibrium,
        i.e., any outcome that can be supported by a set of equilibrium constraints.
        To ensure that all potential solutions are considered, We propose
        to reframe equilibrium constraints as a relaxed mixed-integer 
        linear program. We show that the framework can also be used to 
        narrow down equilibria, by imposing additional equilibrium constraints.
        We provide examples related to static price competition, multi-unit 
        auctions and dynamic games,
        three areas in which counterfactual analysis has proven elusive.

        coauthors: with Mar Reguant
        abstract: |
          The emergence of Real Time Pricing has 
          generated expectations of achieving efficiency 
          in the electricity market. However, consumers have 
          appeared reluctant to accept the bill volatility 
          caused by time variant tariffs. Thus, eliciting
          consumer preferences is a prerequisite to correctly 
          assess the welfare impact of a broad implementation 
          of RTP . In this paper we use detailed household level data from 
          the Spanish electricity market to study how household characteristics
          and preferences influence their electricity tariff choice. We provide model
          free evidence to illustrate that consumers' choices are not only the resolution 
          to a trade-off between mean payments and volatility which resembles that of 
          an insurance market, but are also driven by information frictions and inattention.
          We also propose a stylized two stage choice model that captures these regularities.
